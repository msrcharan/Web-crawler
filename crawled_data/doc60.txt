That is really very gratifying," he said."Everything I lived in this World Cup has been emotional, seeing how much it has been enjoyed in Argentina."There are a lot of years from this year to the next one. I don't think I will be able to do that. To finish this way is brilliant."Argentina will play France or Morocco, who meet on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT, in the final, when Messi is set to make a record 26th appearance in a men's World Cup.The 2026 World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Messi has won the Ballon d'Or - awarded to the world's best player - a record seven times and been named Fifa Best Men's Player once.Other honours include four Champions Leagues, 11 top-flight titles and Copa America glory with Argentina in 2021.The World Cup is the one glaring omission, Argentina having lost to Germany in the 2014 final in Brazil."We are going to do our best, as we have done up until now, so that this time it really happens - we really win it," said Messi, who retired from international duty in June 2016 before reversing his decision two months later."I have been enjoying it the past few years, being with the national side. I am really enjoying everything that is happening to us."To get the Copa America, to reach the World Cup with 36 games unbeaten, and to finish all that trajectory in a final is just incredible."I hope the people in Argentina enjoy themselves and what we are doing. They shouldn't doubt we are giving absolutely everything."Messi, who plays for French giants Paris St-Germain, is one of only six men to have appeared in five World Cups, along with German Lothar Matthaus, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, and Antonio Carbajal, Andres Guardado and Rafael Marquez of Mexico.Currently leading the Golden Boot race in Qatar alongside France's Kylian Mbappe, Messi became the first Argentina player to score in four World Cups and also became their record World Cup scorer with 11 goals.He made his Argentina debut at the age of 18 in 2005 and has scored 97 goals in 172 games.If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-linkGet your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC SoundsAhead of his last chance at World Cup glory, get to know the real person behind the goalsRobin and Strike are hunting for a criminal who goes back a long way...Panorama hits the road to find out what is going on between drivers and cyclists    BBC Sport charts Morocco's journey to becoming the first African nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals as they prepare to take on France in the last four.Watch all of France's goals from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as they prepare to take on Morocco in the semi-finals.Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez shine for Argentina as they beat Croatia 3-0 to reach the World Cup final.Watch as fans in Buenos Aires celebrate Argentina beating Croatia 3-0 to reach their sixth World Cup final.
