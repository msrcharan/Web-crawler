Dowdall admitted at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin that the only evidence that he had given Mr Hutch the key to the hotel room used by David Byrne's murderers was his own testimony.He said it was also correct that the only evidence that Mr Hutch had admitted shooting Mr Byrne dead was Dowdall's own word.Dowdall was due to stand trial for murder with Mr Hutch, but pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of facilitating murder.He has agreed to take part in the Irish witness protection programme in order to give evidence at the trial.The court has heard that whether his application is accepted is not dependent on his performance as a witness in the Gerard Hutch trial.Dowdall was jailed for four years in October after admitting to facilitating the killing by renting a room at the hotel.Asked whether he had decided to give evidence against Mr Hutch to get a lesser sentence, Dowdall said "it was only natural if you're not involved".He denied knowing the hotel room would be used by the murder gang.Dowdall has previously admitted telling lies during secret garda (Irish police) recordings of his conversations with Mr Hutch.In the secret garda recordings, Dowdall talks of planning to blow up a mobile phone owned by someone called Trevor Byrne in County Wexford.On Wednesday, he described those comments as "bravado", "disgusting" and "nonsense" saying he was under surveillance at the time.He also distanced himself from his secretly recorded comments that he had got his uncle Jimmy's house shot at.Brendan Grehan. senior counsel for Mr Hutch, put it to Dowdall that in his dealings with gardaí he was in effect offering to give evidence for the prosecution in this trial in return for having his murder charge dropped.Dowdall replied: "I suppose that's correct, yes".Ex-councillor Dowdall 'has a history of lying'Ex-councillor says Hutch admitted hotel murderEx-councillor can begin evidence in Hutch trialUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
