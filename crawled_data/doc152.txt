It was not easy to find the words. He needed some time to rest."I think he can be proud of what he has done for the national team."In football history, many top players have missed penalties in their career - Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo - but I have no doubt Harry will keep his chin up and help Tottenham and the national team to shine."Lloris' France play Morocco in the World Cup semi-finals on Wednesday as they continue their defence of the title they won four years ago in Russia.Morocco have been the surprise package in Qatar, having beaten Belgium, Spain and Portugal en route to the last four."It will be a hostile atmosphere inside the stadium, but we are ready for anything," added Lloris."Obviously, it is already a success for Morocco - but, believe me, they won't want to stop here."They want to become even more of a hero for their country. We prepare to respond to the demands of a semi-final of a World Cup - it doesn't matter the opponent."France manager Didier Deschamps his players had been prepared for the "loud support" the Atlas Lions will have at Al Bayt Stadium."I don't like the term hostile for the environment because that is negative," he said. "They have great support, which is useful to them."It is very noisy and my staff have told the players about that. It is not going to score you goals, but it is great to have such loud support."When you prepare for a match you have to prepare for the atmosphere - my players know what to expect."Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-linkGet your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC SoundsAhead of his last chance at World Cup glory, get to know the real person behind the goalsRobin and Strike are hunting for a criminal who goes back a long way...Panorama hits the road to find out what is going on between drivers and cyclists    BBC Sport charts Morocco's journey to becoming the first African nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals as they prepare to take on France in the last four.Watch all of France's goals from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as they prepare to take on Morocco in the semi-finals.Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez shine for Argentina as they beat Croatia 3-0 to reach the World Cup final.Watch as fans in Buenos Aires celebrate Argentina beating Croatia 3-0 to reach their sixth World Cup final.
