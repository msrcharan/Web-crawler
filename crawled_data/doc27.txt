deaths go unrecorded.Kenyan President William Ruto’s second-born daughter, Charlene, has defended her remarks on the existence of an office of the first daughter.Kenyan law does not recognise the office of first daughter.In a statement, Ms Ruto says the office is not a government department but is a "private entity".

reads: “Lions, we are with you until victory: Another historic point for
Morocco".Le Matin newspaper says: “The Atlas Lions are determined to honour their
appointment with history”. State TV ran a 10-minute trailer for tonight’s game - sound-tracked by rousing music, ululation and a stirring voice-over. An article on the news website Lakome said Morocco's
achievements at the World Cup have ignited a "sense of optimism and pride
in the hearts of Moroccans that made them forget… their difficult economic
conditions". It included an interview with a man saying the campaign had
"made us forget everything else...the high prices and everything. We want
them to move forward. My mood has changed, praise God!" When the final whistle blew on Morocco’s victory over
Portugal on Saturday, the state broadcaster al-Aoula immediately dropped its
schedule to show scenes of celebrations taking place across the country for
several hours.Drone footage over the capital, Rabat, showed thousands of
Moroccans on the streets and squares revelling in the historic moment. It was a scene echoed in cities across the country, from
Marrakech to Casablanca, and even Laayoune – the capital of the disputed
territory of Western Sahara.A presenter said: "The victory gave the values on which
we were raised a thousand meanings: Faith, parents’ blessings and attachment to
national symbols”.  “This is the Kingdom of Morocco: History, civilisation, a
people, culture and heritage beyond description”. One news
website took it a step further, saying the team’s success was emblematic of
Morocco’s "geo-strategic gains and growing soft power" on the
international stage.  BBC MonitoringThe world through its mediaGhana's President Nana Akufo-Addo has said that African countries must wean themselves off "begging" the West to earn global respect and change poor perceptions about the continent. "If we stop being beggars and spend African money inside the continent, Africa will not need to ask for respect from anyone, we will get the respect we deserve. If we make it prosperous as it should be, respect will follow," Mr Akufo-Addo said. He made the remarks during the opening of the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington DC.Mr Akufo-Addo urged greater solidarity among Africans to address shared aspirations. "Africans are more resilient outside the continent than inside. We must bear in mind that to the outside world, [there's] nothing like Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya, we are simply Africans. Our destiny as people depends on each other," he said.The president said that the continent had skills and manpower but needed concerted political will to make "Africa work".Mr Akufo-Addo's remarks came on the day that the International Monetary Fund agreed to give Ghana a $3bn (£2.4bn) loan to alleviate an unprecedented economic downturn in the West African country. Dozens of African leaders are in Washington to discuss cooperation with the US amid growing Chinese and Russian influence on the continent.Mayeni JonesBBC News, CasablancaMoroccans are eagerly
anticipating their team’s semi-final World Cup match against reigning
champions, France. Morocco became the first Arab and African side to
make it to a World Cup semi-final, after defeating Portugal last week in a shock result.Across
Casablanca, a port city in western Morocco, café owners are setting up for the biggest football game of their lives. Tables are being cleared out, and rows of chairs lined up in front of giant
screens, ready for the throngs of supporters who will be pouring into the city’s
many coffee shops to watch the game. Vendors selling flags and football jerseys
have taken over the Medina, the city’s historical district. Football fans here
say they never expected this day to come, and that the team’s victory would be
a watershed moment, not just for Moroccans, but for the entire African
continent, as well as the Arab world. This is a country which has poured
millions into its national team. That investment appears to be paying off: many
of its players were trained in Morocco rather than abroad. Many here are
praying this homegrown side will make history today.Fans have been taking to Edgware Road with flags and flares as Morocco makes World Cup history.Emery MakumenoBBC News, KinshasaHeavy rainfall on Monday night led to floods in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, Kinshasa, that destroyed many homes and cut off one of the main roads to the the city.The damage left a third of the city with no water and electricity, according to authorities.
