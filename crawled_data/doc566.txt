That kind message gave her a bit of a happy time, if you like, and it's something she's watched over and over and over."Nineteen-year-old Borussia Dortmond player Bellingham said he had heard what Madison had been going through."I just wanted to let you know that we're all behind you. Keep fighting, stay strong, and you'll get through it," he told her.Around 790 people are diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the UK each year, with the majority of cases in children and young adults.Richard said his football-mad daughter, who plays for Nuneaton Borough Girls, was diagnosed at Birmingham Children's Hospital."The sickness is there after chemotherapy, etc, so it's quite tough times. There's up days and there's down days," he said. "But there is good hope, that's the main thing, there is good hope at the end of this.""The local football team that she plays for, the support from that local football team is absolutely overwhelming as well," he added.Bellingham, a former Birmingham City player from Stourbridge, and the England team left Qatar after their quarter final loss to France on Saturday.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
