equivalent vacancies in NHS England in September - a vacancy rate of 9.7%.Nursing vacancies accounted for 47,496 of that overall number - with a vacancy rate of 11.9% in this sector.In December 2019, before the pandemic, the total NHS vacancy rate was 8.1%.By Wanyuan SongBBC NewsInfections rates are rising in China following the easing of lockdown restrictions.By Anthony ReubenBBC Reality CheckDo public or private sector workers get paid more?By Reality Check teamBBC NewsThe prime minister and health secretary both claim they would cost an extra £1,000 per household.By David Brown, Jake Horton & Tural AhmedzadeBBC NewsMilitary equipment is pouring into Ukraine, but President Zelensky says more is needed to stop Russia.By Reality Check teamBBC NewsMichael Gove failed to commit to the government's new-homes target, so what's happening to it?By Reality Check teamBBC NewsThere have been different claims made about how much rail workers get paid.Reality CheckDuring PMQs, the prime minister explained why he did not want to work
with Labour on housing, saying: “In London, the former Conservative mayor in
five years built 60,000 affordable homes. The current Labour mayor half of that
amount.”The Greater London Authority publishes figures for
affordable housing in the capital running from April to March each year.In Boris Johnson’s last five years as mayor (2011-2016),
there were 56,326 homes classified as affordable completed.In the last five years, under Labour's Sadiq Khan, 37,999
were completed, so that is about two thirds as many.By Erwan RivaultBBC NewsThe key route connecting Russia with Crimea was damaged by an explosion in October.Reality CheckHealth Secretary Steve Barclay told BBC Breakfast this morning: “If everyone in the public sector had a pay rise in line with inflation, it would cost an extra £28bn, an extra £1,000 per household.”That figure looks a bit high. The public sector pay bill for all 5.7 million employees was around £233bn last year.Inflation is expected to be about 10% this year, so you could assume that an inflationary pay rise would cost about £23bn.There are about 28 million households in the UK, so that’s about £820 per household.But Ben Zaranko from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that it isn’t really the figure that matters because the government was already budgeting for a 3% average pay rise for the public sector, so increasing that to match inflation would cost about £18bn, or about £640 per household.We have contacted the Treasury to ask if they know where the £28bn figure comes from.By Reality Check teamBBC NewsChina has acknowledged low vaccinations rates for the elderly and is seeking to boost them.By Nicholas Barrett and Anthony ReubenBBC Reality CheckThe government awarded thousands of contracts to private companies during the pandemic.By Shruti MenonBBC Reality CheckIndia and China are buying cheaper oil from Russia as other major economies shun its energy exports.By Reality Check teamBBC NewsEuropean countries are helping consumers facing surging energy prices.By Reality CheckBBC NewsFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage claims London, Birmingham and Manchester are "minority white".By Peter Mwai & Rachel SchraerBBC Reality CheckSome Ugandans have been attacking the government's efforts, even denying the Ebola virus's existence.Reality CheckTransport Secretary Mark Harper said nurses were getting "at least a £1,400 pay rise this year".The government said this in July with increases backdated to April 2022.However, nurses' pay has not kept up with rising prices since 2010.  They have had a real terms pay cut of more than 10%. Their pay has also failed to keep up with average earnings, both in the private sector and the public sector, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).By Anthony Reuben and Lucy GilderBBC Reality CheckNurses have voted to strike. How much do they earn at the moment?Reality CheckAt PMQs, Labour
leader Keir Starmer told MPs: “Britain faces the lowest growth of any OECD
nation over the next two years.”He was referring to
economic forecasts from the OECD, which is a club of 38 member countries.Its latest report
on Tuesday predicted that the UK economy would shrink by 0.4% in 2023 and grow
0.2% in 2024, which is the lowest in the OECD.The prime minister
responded by saying the UK had: “This year the fastest growth in the G7.”The G7 is a smaller
group of big economies.The OECD expects
the UK to grow 4.4% in 2022, which is indeed the fastest in the G7, although
the UK had further to recover, having still not reached the level of economic
output it had before the pandemic.So, they were both
right with these claims, but were looking at different periods and different
economic forecasts.By Rachel SchraerHealth and disinformation reporterA new "documentary" falsely blames Covid vaccines for deaths of young people.Email us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.ukFollow Have Your Say on TwitterWhy you can trust BBC News
