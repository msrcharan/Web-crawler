What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?Here we update some of the key weekly and monthly data for measuring the pandemic and also assess some of the key Covid-19 indicators over the past two years.We are now at a "Covid stable" stage of the pandemic, but a watch is still being kept on infection estimates and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital and deaths as we head towards the winter.One in 70 people - 43,400 - were estimated to have had Covid in the past week, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This is 1.43% of the population.This is slightly more than the 39,600 from the previous week but the ONS said the trend was uncertain in Wales, with the estimate made a little earlier this week and factors such as the postal strike playing a part in fewer samples returned than usual. It follows six successive weeks of falling infections.Since summer 2020, the ONS has organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which now sees people being sent test kits by post.It has become the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing at the end of March.Infections are estimated to be rising in England and Northern Ireland and are uncertain too in Scotland.The estimates are that one in 60 people in England and Scotland and one in 50 in Northern Ireland have the virus.Wales is estimated to have a fewer proportion of people with Covid than any other UK nation or English region.The percentage of people testing positive for Covid has fallen across most ages over recent weeks in Wales, says ONS.The latest daily estimates show infections tend to be a little higher in people in their late 50s and early 60s in Wales.The number of hospital patients testing positive for Covid by 4 December has risen slightly in the past week but half of what we were seeing in mid-October. Very few patients testing positive are being "actively" treated for Covid.We know about 92% of people are currently being treated primarily for other conditions and happen to test positive while in hospital or on admission. The number of patients testing positive for Covid in hospital beds in Wales averaged 248 a day in the week to 4 December - slightly down on the week before and down 26% on a month ago.Of these, there were an average of 219 in acute beds, compared with 210 the week before, so similar numbers.The vast majority continue to be "incidental" Covid patients, who happen to test positive in hospital.Only 20 (8%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on 6 December were being primarily treated for the virus, with 208 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions.When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering, there were 525 people on average in hospital beds over the past week - 6% up on the week before. They make up 5.9% of all hospital patients.There were an average of 242 patients recovering in the week ending 4 December, so they were no longer testing positive for Covid but were  waiting for discharge or for a care package to become available.This can add to pressures on hospitals.Numbers in critical care with Covid are averaging nine a day, roughly the same as we have seen for the past two months.There are 19 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients with the virus.   In April, there were 27 Covid patients in critical care, peaking at 38 in January, while in the second wave it peaked at 150 patients.The mortality rate of critical care Covid patients, in the most recent study of 286 Welsh patients since January 2022, was about 32.9%, including those who died later on a general ward.About 69% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic. The average age of those admitted so far in 2022 is 58, just over half are men and they are likely to be overweight. More than half are from more deprived parts of Wales. About 29% were under 50.The study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December 2021.Numbers of Covid admissions are averaging seven a day, a similar number to the last month.Covid-positive patients only make up 0.8% of all admissions.About 8% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or "actively" treated for the virus on average in the past week. The average number has been 18 in the most recent week, compared to 15 in the previous week.It does not mean these patients cannot have complications because of Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.Broken down by health board, only Cardiff and Vale and Swansea Bay health boards recorded any notable numbers of patients testing positive who were being treated "actively" for Covid in the past week.There has been a higher proportion of patients with Covid being treated primarily for the virus in critical care - and that was eight out of nine acute patients on 6 December.The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus after January 2022 (27%), compared to the period before (nearly 86%).The figures on "incidental" Covid cases have only been published in recent months.Digital Health and Care Wales indicated the data had no standard definition for "actively being treated for Covid", meaning there were some differences between health boards in how they arrived at the figure.Patients who are asymptomatic are no longer being tested routinely.There were 178 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 4 December, the most since the end of October.Public Health Wales figures show in the latest week,  "probably" or "definitely" hospital-acquired cases in patients outnumber those community-acquired or indeterminate Covid cases. Hospital-acquired infections stood at 93, slightly up on the previous four weeks.There have been about 16,650 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic.Separate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated 71.2% were directly due to Covid.In cases where Covid was not the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, "would increase the likelihood of hip fractures".Recent analysis also showed the median length of stay in hospital for Covid had not been above 10 days since the start of the vaccination programme.An indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which hit a high of 95% in the week ending 26 October.It has slipped back slightly in the last month to 93.5%.We know also that recent modelling from Welsh government scientists suggests in a "worst case" scenario that Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions could account for 2,750 hospital beds - or 28% of total capacity at the winter peak in 2022-23.The "most likely" scenario would be 1,390 patients with Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions on 9 December, including 668 with confirmed positive tests for Covid.These figures have not yet been published by Digital Health and Care Wales.Modelling for Covid alone peaked at more than 1,800 patients with the virus in a "worst case scenario" in December.But the actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests has fallen even below the "most likely" scenario and was closer to the "optimistic" scenario after being above the predicted levels until early November.Scientific advisers with a more up to date projection at the end of November suggested hospital bed occupancy with Covid would continue to decline to December and reach a plateau in the following weeks. A slight increase in Covid admissions was projected towards the end of January and February.Another measure of pressure on the health service is NHS staff absence.A total of 0.6% of staff - about 649 - were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 28 November. Another 0.2% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the bi-monthly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. Total absence stands at 6%, a little higher than the usual pre-pandemic figure of about 5%.The quarterly average to June was 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the three months to March, which was the second highest rate on record.The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests 95.9% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.All UK nations are close to or at 96%-97%.The estimate is 98% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 92.4% for those aged 60 to 64. At the higher threshold, 73.4% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and well over 77.6% in those aged 16 to 24 and 91.6% of the 75-79 age group.As part of its weekly swab survey, involving many thousands of people across the UK, some participants also have their level of antibodies checked in a blood test and are also asked a series of other questions towards fact-finding about Covid.Scientific advisers to the Welsh government said 0.6% of people aged 12 and over were estimated to be at risk of going to hospital with Covid at the start of April 2022, compared with 9.3% two years before, at the start of the pandemic.And for those at-risk groups, 6% were estimated to be at risk of needing hospital treatment and 7% of the over 60s.This is thanks to vaccination and natural protection from immunity after having infection.The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and has now fallen back to around two per 100,000. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - has been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid.Expressed within a range, if it's above 1, this indicates that infections are growing. The range remains between 0.8 and 1, suggesting infections are falling. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another eight and 10 people would be infected.The number of people who have died when Covid was a contributory factor has reached 11,109 in Wales, for registrations so far.In the most recent week, up to 25 November, 15 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it included as a contributory factor on their death certificate, according to the ONS.This is the lowest weekly total since the end of September.Half of counties registered any deaths involving Covid: Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Carmarthenshire, Conwy, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Swansea and Vale of GlamorganWhen counted by day occurring - not day registered - there were nine deaths involving Covid in the past week registered so far, compared to 10 in the previous week.However, the most recent weekly figures are usually an underestimate, due to delays in registrations catching up.Up to 25 November, a total of 11,109 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales.ONS says that up to the end of October, of deaths registered so far, there have been 9,199 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death.Deaths involving Covid are running lower than at the same point in 2021, with the total number of deaths involving Covid in the last three months at 47% of what we saw in the same period in 2021.There were 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022, the most since January. This was at the height of the summer heatwave.The Omicron wave from December 2021 brought a peak in deaths of 20 on 15 January 2022, the same level as the peaks in deaths in September and October.The ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.During 2021, there were 4,029 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.That includes 209 deaths in December 2021. In December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.The second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.ONS also records so-called "excess deaths". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared with the five-year, non-pandemic average.So since March 2020, there have been 8,226 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.That includes more than 1,194 excess deaths in 2022.There have been 1,093 deaths from all causes above the non-pandemic average since July with 439 of them not involving Covid.Deaths have been above the five-year pre-pandemic norm for all but two of the last 25 weeks.There were 700 deaths from all causes - this is 14 more (2%) than the average in the most recent week. Covid accounted for 2.1% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, less than the proportion in England (3.1%).Across England and Wales, in nearly two thirds (61.8%) of deaths with Covid mentioned on the death certificate, it was also the underlying cause of death in the latest week.Nearly a fifth (18.2%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes.There was one death involving Covid involving a care home resident registered in the latest week - out of 116 deaths overall.Care Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,251 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid since the pandemic began.It had been notified of four deaths involving Covid during November.ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in men than in England or any English region.Covid was the second highest cause of death in care home residents after dementia, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths.Covid-19 was the seventh leading cause of death in Wales in October, after being the 10th leading cause in September.Mortality analysis by the ONS showed deaths due to Covid - 103 in total occurred over the month - accounted for 3.5% of all registered deaths. It was 3.3% of all deaths in England in October.Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 147 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 4.9% of all deaths registered in October.Dementia was the leading cause of death in September in Wales for the third month in succession. Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth, ahead of Covid, with its mortality rate for a second month in succession.The mortality rate for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions was significantly higher (58.3%) than the five-year average, according to ONS.Covid, which was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021, is now the sixth leading cause of death so far in 2022, after heart disease, dementia, chronic lower respiratory diseases, lung and throat cancers and strokes.It is significantly lower than the five leading causes of death.Flu and pneumonia is still ranked seventh so far in 2022.The ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in October was 34.6 deaths per 100,000 - an increase on September's figure. Across the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is about the same in Wales (120 deaths per 100,000), as England on 119.7 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (111) and Northern Ireland (110.8) both lower in the 32 months to the end of October.The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales.It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England.When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales.The ONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70.1% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in October. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic, 83.7% of deaths with Covid on death certificates can be said to be due to Covid since the pandemic began.So, there were 9,199 deaths due to Covid by the end of October in Wales, 54% of them male.In about 4% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was "suspected".A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.By 25 November, RCT had reached a total of 1,143 deaths and also had the eighth highest crude mortality rate (480.9 deaths per 100,000) of all local authorities across England and Wales.Merthyr Tydfil (476.2 deaths per 100,000) was the ninth highest and Bridgend 15th (459.1 deaths per 100,000).RCT has overtaken Cardiff (1,135) for the most deaths in Wales up to 25 November.Six of RCT's communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further.At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 153.3 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the pandemic up to the end of October 2022. This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 63.9 deaths due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 100.4.The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West, with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid.This was followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021.When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years.This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire.All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic.The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llasanffraid Glan Conwy.At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales.The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way so do not expect to see the same thing:This video can not be playedThe different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in WalesPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.There is a difference of about 3,000 deaths.According to the PHW measure, by 7 December there had been a total of 8,068 deaths with Covid, with nine deaths being reported in the most recent week.PHW has now switched to only weekly reporting.We do not know how many of these people have died of Covid, only that they tested positive in the weeks before they died.With the large number of "incidental" Covid cases in hospital during the Omicron wave, it is a less reliable measure to use day to day.More than 8.5m doses of vaccine have been administered in Wales since December 2020.The vast majority in the last week have been autumn boosters, with the programme running at around 5,000 a day, a drop on recent weeks.So far, more than a million autumn boosters have been given out, reaching more than 86% of care home residents and nearly 79% of over 65s. More than half of those aged 50 to 64 have also had autumn boosters.Wales has reached proportionately more of key groups with autumn boosters than England, although fewer than Scotland so far.There are also fewer of the key groups reached than the earlier phases of the programme.The boosters were reaching fewer elderly people from black and ethnic minorities, with the gap widest in the over 80s - just 40% compared to 54% of white over 80s by early October.Ceredigion had reached fewest of the over 65s but still over 68% and Vale of Glamorgan had reached the most (86.4%).Monmouthshire has reached the most in the 50s to 64 age group (67.6%) with Torfaen the fewest (33%).The previous booster campaign saw 85% of those eligible being given a dose.Public Health Wales is now only reporting Covid vaccination figures weekly.Meanwhile, 69% of the over 65s have so far had a flu vaccine - the same time as this time last year. Fewer two and three year olds have had the vaccine since this time last year.The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron in 2022, and 976 new cases have been sequenced in the last month.Because of the ending of mass testing in April, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more.So far, 29,222 cases of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, have been recorded in Wales but very few cases in recent months.It overtook the "original" Omicron in all areas of Wales but this sub-variant itself has been overtaken by other sub-variants, especially BA.5.There have been more than a hundred cases of the new sub-variant BQ.1 again in the last week - related to the BA.5 strain.Infection estimates by ONS suggest BA.5 overtook the BA.1 strain in early March, while the following BA.4 and BA.5 strains overtook BA.2 in the second week of June in Wales.Health officials say the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants are six times more transmissible than the original Wuhan Covid strain but that vaccines were still working to prevent serious illness in most people.The numbers of people who are reporting they have long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected are estimated to be at record levels. There are 61,000 people -  or 2% of the population - who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid.A total of 114,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, more than half said long Covid had a "little" impact on their daily lives, and 24% said none at all but 20% said it had "a lot" of impact.An estimated 3.73% of people in Wales report having Covid - this is the same as in Scotland, lower than in Northern Ireland but higher than all regions of England except North West and North East.The estimates are based on a sample size of 14,223 people in Wales.Across the UK, prevalence was greatest in the 50 to 69 age group, in women, and in people living in deprived areas.A survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50.Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks.Fatigue, "brain fog" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms.Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid.In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid.But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales.This analysis was used to develop a "social cost" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic.With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022.Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid.When we look at infections in communities, broken down into middle-layer super output areas, with populations averaging 5,000, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas.This is still noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes.The Wales positivity rate was around 12% in early-November - but there are far fewer PCR tests after the end of mass testing in April.At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate reached 51.6%.Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest.Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high.There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021.Between January and March there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results this winter.In the most recent week, the 40 to 59 year age group still had the highest incidence for lateral flow test positives. All of Wales' 22 council areas saw falls in their under-25 case rates in the last week of figures, which included the period when mass testing ended. The 30 to 39 age group had the largest proportion of cases in the last, most reliable week for PCR tests.Over the winter months, the under-19 age group has made up 20% of cases, a rise on the year before.More than 8.7 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020.For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020.This ended at the start of April 2022, although it will remain in place for hospital patients and there will be some for vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes.There are around 4,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, compared to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak.Testing that's processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place.Free lateral flow tests (LFTs) are no longer available, except to certain groups and in certain settings.From the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, they had been used more for asymptomatic people going to work or attending events.Then between April and July 2022, people with symptoms were asked to take LFTs.The number reporting tests had been falling as a result of the end of freely-available LFT kits but after a short rise numbers have fallen again.The most recent week saw the lowest weekly total so far with 9,221 results, with 1,466 positive.Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy.Since the end of mass testing, only about 4,000-5,000 PCR tests are being carried out each week.Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020.Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances.Care Inspectorate Wales figures also show 26 care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid.Meanwhile, absence in general was much higher than in previous years - running at an average of 11% in primary-aged pupils and 16.3% in secondary-aged children during the 2021-22 academic year.This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years.Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds.In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million.That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending.The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system.Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in WalesIs the Covid pandemic finally over in Wales?Nine new Covid symptoms added to official listTwo years since first Covid death in WalesCoronavirus deaths in Wales pass 5,000Schools in Wales may open during summer holidayWales' road out of lockdown - in 10 chartsWales sees highest weekly Covid deaths of pandemicHospitals under pressure - in numbersCovid-19 deaths at highest level since JuneHow has the coronavirus wave looked across Wales?Can 'excess deaths' figures show extent of virus?Wales only part of UK without falling Covid ratesHigher virus death rate in poorer areas - ONSWhy are more BAME people dying from coronavirus?How big is the epidemic in care homes?Covid-19 in the UKCovid map: Where are cases the highest?The man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
