 From ten finalists, this beautiful image was chosen to be the winner by the public. Thousands voted for this photograph of "The Dark Hedges" which is the famous film location from Game of Thrones.It was taken at Armoy, Causeaway Coast and Glens in Northern Ireland by Weather Watcher 'Noreensireland' whose real name is Noreen Mack. She said she had to be really patient to find a clickable moment as the location is so popular with film fans.Noreen took up photography four years ago as a hobby along with her husband Peter. Recently the couple bought a campervan so they can capture the sunset and the sunrise in the same location. She told BBC Weather: "We had visited The Dark Hedges before but went back and slept in the van overnight hoping to be the only ones there early next morning. But as we drank a coffee suddenly many other photographers began to arrive."We went and joined the many people who lined up across the road waiting for the light to take their photos."Many congratulations to our winner, and very well done to all the other shortlisted finalists.
