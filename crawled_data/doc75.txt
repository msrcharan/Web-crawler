Hollywood's best known mountain lion, or cougar, has been captured and tranquilised, weeks after a fatal attack on a pet chihuahua.The wild cat P-22, famous for roaming through residential areas, was caught on CCTV frequently.P-22 has been popular with locals and tourists, but is quite elderly at the age of 12.Authorities had become alarmed about his increasingly "agitated" behaviour, say reports.The National Park service confirmed that P-22 was responsible for killing a chihuahua that was being walked in the Hollywood hills last month.Sarah Picchi, a Los Feliz resident who found P-22,  told the Los Angeles Times that Fish and Wildlife Department officers rang at her front gate and said: "You have a lion in your back yard." Ms Picchi said he was tranquilised on Monday morning. Officials said he was in a stable condition after his sedation.The local feline celebrity was part of a National Park service study. He was often recorded by security cameras near LA's Griffith Park, a wilderness and picnic area.He wore a GPS tracking collar, which allowed officials to view him prowling further away from his home range than usual.P-22 is 12 years old, making him the oldest Southern California cougar to be studied. Most mountain lions live for only a decade.Typically he would only hunt deer and coyotes, but there were growing concerns following the chihuahua attack and another suspected dog attack in the Silver Lake neighbourhood this month."P-22 is a remarkably old cat in the wild and, after being deemed responsible for killing a leashed pet last month, may be exhibiting signs of distress," the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said.The department said it would "determine the best next steps for the animal while also prioritising the safety of surrounding communities".Nothing has been disclosed about what will happen to the cougar.Mountain lion killed in CaliforniaMother fights off mountain lion attacking her sonBig cat roams in Hollywood HillsMountain lion hides under LA houseUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
