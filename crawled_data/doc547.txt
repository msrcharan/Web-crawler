Families are calling for better safety at a lake where three boys died after being pulled out of the icy water.The children, aged eight, 10 and 11, were playing at Babbs Mill Park, in Kingshurst, near Solihull, on Sunday.A fourth boy rescued from the lake is still in hospital where his condition remains critical, police said.The community has suggested having a fence around the lake and more signage, Shesh Sheshabhatter, a councillor on Solihull Borough Council said.He and fellow councillors are going to try to push the council for improved safety measures, he added.Putting cameras in the area was another suggestion from the community.The carpet of flowers, balloons, soft toys and messages of love near the lake is growing by the hour. A vigil was held at the site on Monday evening. Family members of one of the boys have visited the scene to look at the tributes. There is a continuing atmosphere of shock and grief touching everyone who visits the impromptu memorial. One person told the BBC it did not seem real and the sight of the growing collection of toys and tributes to the "Babbs Mill boys" made it a very sad reality. Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative MP for Meriden, said at Prime Minister Questions (PMQs) the community at Kingshurst which he represents had suffered "an unimaginable tragedy" and the families were in his thoughts and prayers. He asked the prime minister to join him in paying tribute to the "community in Kingshurst which has come together and is supporting each other to get through this tragedy". "And will you recognise the heroic efforts of the emergency services, including the police officer who used his bare hands to try and break through the ice and then jumped in the water with fire service personnel, without the PPE, risking their own lives to save the young children," he said. Rishi Sunak sent his condolences to the families and friends of the boys who died and paid tribute to the emergency services for "their incredibly selfless actions". "This whole event has completely shocked the local community," added Mr Sunak. The aunt of the 10-year-old who died, named locally as Jack Johnson, thanked the local community on social media for their support.Charlotte McIlmurray said the pain of losing the boys was a "nightmare".His school, St Anthony's Catholic Primary, shut on Monday but reopened the following day. Staff issued a statement saying a difficult day had been made easier by an amazing community of staff, children and family members. Emergency services were called to Babbs Mill Park on Sunday afternoon after reports of children who had been on the ice getting into difficulties.Searches of the lake continued throughout Tuesday although police stressed there was no suggestion anybody else was missing.A group of 21 police officers from the Chelmsley Wood neighbourhood team stood silent for two minutes when visiting the site on Tuesday and thanked the community for the kindness shown towards the force. Birmingham City manager John Eustace also laid a wreath on behalf of the football club.Leroy Moss, who runs a kickboxing gym in the area, said the atmosphere was "eerie"."You can tell something's happened here, it's not a nice feeling, it's a sad feeling," Mr Moss said.Another vigil is due to be held at the weekend.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
