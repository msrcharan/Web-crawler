reads: “Lions, we are with you until victory: Another historic point for
Morocco".Le Matin newspaper says: “The Atlas Lions are determined to honour their
appointment with history”. State TV ran a 10-minute trailer for tonight’s game - sound-tracked by rousing music, ululation and a stirring voice-over. An article on the news website Lakome said Morocco's
achievements at the World Cup have ignited a "sense of optimism and pride
in the hearts of Moroccans that made them forget… their difficult economic
conditions". It included an interview with a man saying the campaign had
"made us forget everything else...the high prices and everything. We want
them to move forward. My mood has changed, praise God!" When the final whistle blew on Morocco’s victory over
Portugal on Saturday, the state broadcaster al-Aoula immediately dropped its
schedule to show scenes of celebrations taking place across the country for
several hours.Drone footage over the capital, Rabat, showed thousands of
Moroccans on the streets and squares revelling in the historic moment. It was a scene echoed in cities across the country, from
Marrakech to Casablanca, and even Laayoune – the capital of the disputed
territory of Western Sahara.A presenter said: "The victory gave the values on which
we were raised a thousand meanings: Faith, parents’ blessings and attachment to
national symbols”.  “This is the Kingdom of Morocco: History, civilisation, a
people, culture and heritage beyond description”. One news
website took it a step further, saying the team’s success was emblematic of
Morocco’s "geo-strategic gains and growing soft power" on the
international stage.  Mayeni JonesBBC News, CasablancaMoroccans are eagerly
anticipating their team’s semi-final World Cup match against reigning
champions, France. Morocco became the first Arab and African side to
make it to a World Cup semi-final, after defeating Portugal last week in a shock result.Across
Casablanca, a port city in western Morocco, café owners are setting up for the biggest football game of their lives. Tables are being cleared out, and rows of chairs lined up in front of giant
screens, ready for the throngs of supporters who will be pouring into the city’s
many coffee shops to watch the game. Vendors selling flags and football jerseys
have taken over the Medina, the city’s historical district. Football fans here
say they never expected this day to come, and that the team’s victory would be
a watershed moment, not just for Moroccans, but for the entire African
continent, as well as the Arab world. This is a country which has poured
millions into its national team. That investment appears to be paying off: many
of its players were trained in Morocco rather than abroad. Many here are
praying this homegrown side will make history today.Fans have been taking to Edgware Road with flags and flares as Morocco makes World Cup history.By Sarah SmithNorth America editorThe man accused of making the Lockerbie bomb should face execution in the US, Bill Barr tells the BBC.By Nicolas Negoce & Damian ZaneBBC NewsThe nine Malian babies had been receiving specialist care in Morocco where they were born last year.By David GrittenBBC NewsTehran's prosecutor-general says courts have handed "rioters" jail terms of up to 10 years.Eva Kaili, one of four suspects, is stripped of her role as vice-president of the European Parliament.First Minister Mark Drakeford answers MSs' questions, for the last time in 2022.Suzanne VanhooymissenBBC Africa EyeStalled and inadequate investigations into the deaths of 37 migrants on the Moroccan-Spanish border "smacks of a cover-up" by those two nations, says the rights group Amnesty International.Its report finds "evidence of crimes under international law at the Melilla border" where at least 37 sub-Saharan African migrants died while attempting to cross from Morocco into Spain on 24 June.The BBC Africa Eye investigation, Death on the Border, also uncovered evidence contradicting the official version of events.A joint statement by UN special experts has since raised the official death count from 23 to 37 citing "excessive and lethal use of force by Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement authorities".The Amnesty International report marks six months since the tragedy. "The unlawful force used in Melilla has left an indelible stain not just on the hands of the Moroccan and Spanish security forces, but also on the hands of all those pushing racist migration policies, predicated on the likelihood of harm and violence against those seeking to cross borders," said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard."Instead of fortifying borders, authorities must open safe and legal routes for people seeking safety in Europe," she added.The Spanish and Moroccan authorities have declined to comment on the new allegations.By David CowanHome affairs correspondent, BBC ScotlandBBC Scotland's David Cowan recalls the trial 22 years ago of two men accused of the Lockerbie bombing.Mike ThomsonBBC World Service NewsThe Moroccan Football Federation says it's giving fans 13,000 free tickets for the country’s World Cup semi-final against France on Wednesday.
