Telephone scammers posed as police officers to target older people on multiple occasions in December, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said.Nine incidents were reported in Belfast last Tuesday and Wednesday. In most cases, those targeted were told they were being called in relation to fraudulent activity and asked if there was money at their house.Some were told to leave cash in a bag outside their home. The fraudsters said they were from the police or PSNI, sometimes mentioning specific police stations.The majority of calls were made to people in their seventies, eighties and nineties. Officers said no money had been lost in any of the incidents reported last week. PSNI Det Ch Insp Ian Wilson described the latest telephone scam as "despicable" and said if people were called in this way they should immediately hang up.He warned older people and their families to be vigilant."Police officers will never ask you to withdraw or transfer money for any reason," he said.  "The perpetrators have one aim and that's preying on members of our older community to swindle them out of their money."He said the impact of this type of scam could be "devastating", leaving people frightened and distressed. In July, the Consumer Council reported £381,313 was lost to scammers in Northern Ireland though internet, telephone, postal and doorstep fraud.Last year seven people were charged after a similar scam in which 36 victims handed over a total of £135,000 in cash.Warning after NI scam victims lose £380k in JulyMore than 300 targeted in bogus police phone scamUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
