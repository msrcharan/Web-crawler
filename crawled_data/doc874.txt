An investigation found his appointments were legal, and that he used his extra powers only once - to overrule a minister in a matter unrelated to the pandemic.But it ruled Mr Morrison "fundamentally undermined" responsible government. Another inquiry found that most of his appointments had "little if any connection to the pandemic".The Albanese government has already promised new laws that would require any similar appointments to be publicly disclosed in future.But Mr Albanese said the parliament also had a duty to condemn his predecessor's actions.They put Australia on a "slippery slope" away from "precious" democracy, he said on Wednesday."The public didn't know something it was entitled to know... that undermined the functioning of this parliament, that undermined our democratic institutions."Mr Morrison told parliament that with hindsight he believed his decisions had been "unnecessary" and he'd given them "insufficient consideration"."None of us can claim to be infallible in such circumstances, and I do not," he said.But he stopped short of an apology, and argued the censure was about "political intimidation" and "retribution".Most of his centre-right coalition colleagues supported that view, but one MP, Bridget Archer, said she didn't accept Mr Morrison's explanation of his actions and supported the censure."And I'm deeply disappointed by the lack of genuine apology, or more importantly, understanding of the impact of these decisions," she said in parliament.Former Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews - one of the colleagues who unknowingly shared a portfolio with Mr Morrison - also abstained from the vote.A censure is the parliament's way of formally expressing disapproval in an MP. Such motions are rare and largely symbolic, but they can have political consequences.Controversy hits Queen's representative in AustraliaScott Morrison runs out of miraclesIs this the end for 'Side Hustle Scotty'?Ex-Australia PM 'undermined' government principlesReport savages ex-Australia PM over secret rolesUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
