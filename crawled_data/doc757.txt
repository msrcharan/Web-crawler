A striking portrait of a Helena's tree frog peering through the night has won the British Ecological Society's annual photography competition.Conservation photographer and evolutionary biologist Roberto García Roa took the picture in the Tambopata reserve in the Peruvian Amazon."Like two beacons in the dark, the striking eyes... seem to glow in the darkness of the night," he said.Illegal gold mining has taken a huge environmental toll on the reserve."It is paradoxical to see the eyes of this frog as small golden pearls," said Mr García Roa. "Because in reality, the true treasure lies in ensuring the protection of this area and its inhabitants." The annual photography competition focuses on showcasing the beauty of ecology.Here is a selection of the winning pictures:Runner Up: Leopard Surprise!People and Nature category winner: New Plastic HomeUp Close and Personal category, student prize: Morning DewIndividuals and Populations category, highly commended: Proud StagPeople and Nature category, student prize: Tourists in the WildThe Art of Ecology category, student prize: Diwali in the ForestUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
