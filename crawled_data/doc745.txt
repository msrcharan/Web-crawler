Now, camera in hand, they plead with people clicking selfies to try their services.They spend hours on the temple premises, hustling the crowd, jostling with each other, hoping to make a little more money than they did the previous day.

All they want, he said, is an image for Facebook or Instagram. Video by Anshul Verma'Selfies are taking away our livelihood' Video, 00:04:14'Selfies are taking away our livelihood'Up Next.
