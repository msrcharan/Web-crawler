Mr Bankman-Fried invited the BBC to the residential complex in the Bahamas where he still lives and said he hopes to find a way to pay back FTX users."I'm going to be thinking about how we can help the world and if users haven't gotten much back, I'm going to be thinking about what I can do for them. And I think at the very least I have a duty to FTX users to do right by them as best as I can," he told me.This video can not be playedSam Bankman-Fried denies claims he knew FTX customer money was used for risky financial betsAsked if he planned to start a new business venture to earn the money to pay investors back, he said: "I would give anything to be able to do that. And I'm going to try if I can."Bankruptcy lawyers have described the FTX scandal as "one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America".They accuse Mr Bankman-Fried of running the company as "his own personal fiefdom".The US Senate Banking Committee wants the former CEO to testify at next week's hearings into the collapsed exchange, and he said on Friday that he would attend.At the top of a long list of alleged failings, there are allegations that Mr Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund was using FTX customers' money to make risky financial bets. A former senior FTX employee who worked with Mr Bankman-Fried has told the BBC he thinks the former CEO must have been aware that Alameda Research was using FTX customer funds.He accused Mr Bankman-Fried of lying when he said in recent interviews that he did not know about the flows of cash and cryptocurrencies between the companies."No that's not true," Mr Bankman-Fried said, while going on to acknowledge that as CEO he was ultimately responsible for any mishandling of funds. "That's on me, one way or another," he said.Asked whether he was fraudulent or incompetent, he replied: "I didn't knowingly commit fraud, I don't think I committed fraud, I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." The American has conducted nine lengthy self-critical interviews in the last six days.His team say they've had to relocate to an unknown location in the luxury resort where he lives, because of "security concerns".Reporters have taken pictures of him in his apartment with telescopic lenses from the sea, and at least two YouTubers have managed to sneak into the complex to film videos.Mr Bankman-Fried, who comes from a wealthy family, claims to be concerned about his own personal finances with no access to his bank accounts and "less than $100K left".When asked if he is preparing for the possibility of arrest and prison, he said: "There's some time at night ruminating, yes, but when I get up during the day, I try and focus, be as productive as I can and ignore things that are out of my control."Crypto giant FTX collapses into bankruptcy'I'm waiting to get £2,000 back from crypto giant'US governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
