Edited by Sarah Fowler and Andrew HumphreyAll times stated are UKWhile we wait for the court to resume sitting, lets hear from Zara Aleena's aunt, who spoke to the BBC back in July."The one word that would describe Zara would be independent." "She was incredibly giving, supportive, insightful... empathic and fearless."Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyThe prosecution spent just over an hour detailing out the murder of Zara Aleena.If you are just joining our coverage here is a quick summary of the key points made by Oliver Glasgow KC:Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyIn the conclusion to his opening speech Oliver Glasgow KC said when Jordan McSweeney left the pub in Ilford on the night of 25 June 2021, he was "determined to find, to attack and to kill a woman". Mr Glasgow said McSweeney followed and tried to catch three women and he confronted another, before he saw Zara Aleena. "Zara Aleena did not stand a chance. She had no idea Jordan McSweeney was behind her and, once he had grabbed her, there was nothing she could do.""Zara Aleena had every right to walk home alone and to expect to be safe when she did just that."Jordan McSweeney choose to take that away from her in a brutal and shocking manner."Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyProsecutor Oliver Glasgow KC finished by saying "Zara Aleena did not stand a chance" that night. He has now concluded the facts of the case and the court is rising for lunch until 14:00. Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyOn the evening of his arrest Jordan McSweeney called his mother and could be heard saying that he had been "bang to rights", Oliver Glasgow KC continues.The prosecutor says a subsequent search of the Valentines Park site was then conducted.Mr Glasgow explained that police found a black JD Sports drawstring bag under one of the huts. "The bag contained bloodstained white trainers and blue jeans, matching the clothing that Jordan McSweeney had been reported wearing on the evening of 25 June 2022."McSweeney made no reply following caution and being charged with the murder and rape of Zara Aleena, Mr Glasgow says.Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyOliver Glasgow KC says he is about to finish the facts of the case - hinting that it is nearly time to beak for lunch.Turning to the police investigation he says Jordan McSweeney was quickly identified as the prime suspect.He was arrested at 15:44 after being found sleeping inside a caravan in Valentines Park.Mr Glasgow says: "He was taken to Leyton Custody Suite. On being booked into custody, Jordan McSweeney disclosed that he was on medication for ADHD and suffered from a split personality disorder". McSweeney also told police he had been bitten by a dog earlier and was subsequently taken to Whipps Cross Hospital for treatment. "However, Jordan McSweeney became restless and irritated whilst waiting to be seen and ultimately refused treatment," Mr Glasgow said."He was then transported back to Leyton Custody Suite without being triaged, where he became ‘very aggressive’ and threatened police officers saying: 'we’re going to get fighting then' and 'just because I’m in cuffs, don’t think I’m, I’ll bite your face off cuz… it’s not a joke'."Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyWarning: This post contains upsetting details about the caseOliver Glasgow KC says the post-mortem examination of Zara Aleena was conducted by Dr Matthew Cieka on 26 June 2022 at Poplar Public Mortuary."In total there were 46 separate injuries that were found," Mr Glasgow says."Dr Cieka concluded that Zara Aleena had died because of the traumatic brain injury, the prolonged neck compression, and the blood loss. "In short, she had been stamped and strangled to death."Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyNow, Oliver Glasgow KC has turned to the moment Zara Aleena's body was discovered on Cranbrook Road.A husband and his wife walking along the street came across the 35-year-old, who was badly injured but still breathing, Mr Glasgow explains.They then rang the doorbells of nearby houses trying to seek more help.Emergency services were called and rushed to the scene as one woman, Maria Burgum, gave CPR.For over an hour, treatment was given on the street by doctors and medics."Zara Aleena was transferred to the Royal London Hospital at 04:34 and delivered to the awaiting trauma team at 04:48," Mr Glasgow states.But despite the efforts of doctors, she was declared dead at 9:58am.Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyZara's aunt appears to be trying to hold back tears as Oliver Glasgow KC describes McSweeney repeatedly stamping on her niece.This distressing CCTV footage is being played out on screens around the courtroom.Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyWarning: This post contains upsetting details about the caseOliver Glasgow KC says Jordan McSweeney leaves but then returns to stamp on Zara Aleena.He then goes to her and bends down, appearing to be looking for something, the prosecutor explains as the CCTV continues to be played to court.Mr Glasgow adds: "He then stamps on her for a final and utterly gratuitous time before walking away without pausing to think about what he has just done. "When the police subsequently searched the area, the indistinct items that he had picked up from the floor were to become clear. "Her keys and underwear were found discarded on the ground a few doors down the street; her purse was found thrown into a bush further along the street; her leggings were found hanging over a tree branch a little further on; and her mobile telephone was found in the driveway of one
of the houses by a resident the next morning. "Having dragged her off the street, sexually assaulted her, repeatedly stamped on her until her body was broken, and then thrown away her clothes and possessions, Jordan McSweeney went home to bed."Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyZara Aleena's aunt has returned to the courtroom. The CCTV footage is still playing. It's from a camera looking down onto the driveway where McSweeney has dragged Aleena. The picture isn't completely clear - but the words of the prosecutor are. He describes McSweeney's "savage" attack on Aleena.Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyWe have just seen the moment sexual predator Jordan McSweeney grabbed Zara Aleena from behind and dragged her onto a driveway.There was a gasp in court as the footage was played. It is shocking to see. McSweeney can then be seen attacking Aleena as she tries to escape. Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyWarning: Details in this post contain upsetting details about the caseWe know that Zara Aleena was fatally attacked on Cranbrook Road, which Oliver Glasgow KC describes as a well lit area with houses on both sides and cars using the busy street.The prosecutor continues: "Jordan McSweeney waited for his opportunity to strike and, as soon as he believed that no one was watching, that is exactly what he did.Mr Glasgow says Jordan McSweeney grabbed Zara Aleena from behind with both arms; one arm appearing to cover her mouth, and the other around her neck, before he dragged her into a driveway."She did all she could to fight him off, but she had no idea he was behind her and she must have been terrified as the bigger and stronger Jordan McSweeney dragged her into the darkness and out of sight from any potential rescuer."Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyZara Aleena's family has just left the courtroom as footage is played of McSweeney following her home on the night he brutally attacked her. They understandably do not wish to see her final moments and what he did to her.The CCTV footage is distressing to watch, knowing what is about to follow.We can see McSweeney following Zara Aleena - he is only a few metres behind her.Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyMore CCTV of Zara Aleena's last movements have been played in court.Oliver Glasgow KC says as Aleena approached the junction where Northbrook Road meets Cranbrook Road, Jordan McSweeney emerged."It is clear from the footage that he appears to start walking south towards Ilford but on seeing Zara Aleena he pauses, waits for her to walk past, and then crosses the road so that he is not behind her," the prosecutor says."Jordan McSweeney starts to follow Zara Aleena – this must be the moment that he has decided to attack her."Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyWe're about 45 minutes into Oliver Glasgow KC's opening and he is now speaking about Zara Aleena and her movements on the night she was killed.The 35-year-old was with her friend Bhamini Bati that evening and they spent the first part of their night out at The Great Spoon of Ilford pub having some food and drinks.After leaving the pub, the friends went to nearby Champs Sports Bar and stayed there until just before 02:00.Mr Glasgow adds: "Whilst they were there, Zara Aleena drank only water."At the end of the night, Bhamini Bati, who had booked a taxi, was collected from outside the venue."Aleena walked home along Ilford High Road and then onto Cranbrook Road.Having arrived home, Bati called Aleena’s mobile at 02:03 but Aleena did not pick up, Mr Glasgow says.Bati then saw a missed call from Aleena's mobile at 02:09 and called her back at 02:18, again receiving no response. Mr Glasgow adds: "Bhamini Bati then sent a WhatsApp message at 02:20 which read ‘Y home hun?’ to which there was no reply. "The reason for the lack of any reply is that by that time, Zara Aleena had been attacked."For many, Zara's death represents a wider issue of violence
against women and girls. Several women's charities have come out in support of the demonstration
outside the Old Bailey this morning, as the sentencing hearing continues inside the building. The End Violence Against
Women coalition, a group of over 100 support services, charities and activists,
demands “answers about missed opportunities to prevent her murder and
urgent action to stop this happening again”.Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyJordan McSweeney then spent 50 minutes walking up and down Cranbrook Road, the prosecutor says.Just before 02:00 he saw a fourth young woman who was walking alone. Oliver Glasgow KC says: "He walked quickly up behind her and, whilst she was seemingly oblivious to his presence, two men on the other side of the road stopped and watch him. "His behaviour is clearly alarming - he is after all walking only a metre or two behind this woman - but the pair of them turn out of sight into Northbrook Road and the two men walk off."The woman was "aware of the danger" she was in as she repeatedly looked over her shoulder, Mr Glasgow says."Jordan McSweeney who is on the opposite pavement gesticulated towards her with his arms, as if to indicate that he did not mean her any harm. "Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth."The woman entered a property and McSweeney walked back in the direction he had walked.Mr Glasgow reiterates again: "It is beyond dispute that that young woman had a very lucky escape since, had she been caught, by Jordan McSweeney, she would have been attacked and killed."Thomas Mackintoshreporting from the Old BaileyShowing more CCTV to the court, Oliver Glasgow KC says Jordan McSweeney pursued a second woman close to 00:30 on 26 June.The prosecutor says: "She was inside a takeaway restaurant – Samiz Chicken Shop – and he went inside, took a seat. "He started to stare at the woman and, as he did so, he put his hand down the inside of the front of his trousers."When the woman left the restaurant a few minutes later, he started to follow her, the prosecutor says.Mr Glasgow adds: "She is completely unaware that he is behind her but fortunately for her, his attention becomes distracted by another woman. "Just as before, it is beyond dispute that that young woman had a very lucky escape since, had she been caught, by Jordan McSweeney, she would have been attacked and killed."A third woman then catches McSweeney's eye, so he abandons his attention on the one he spotted inside the chicken shop and he directs his focus on the woman who he then puts an arm around.That woman also walked away, Mr Glasgow says.Helena Wilkinsonreporting from the Old BaileyA reminder that McSweeney has refused to come up from the cells for his sentencing hearing. We are now watching clear CCTV footage on screens around the courtroom of McSweeney in the hours before he murdered Zara.As the footage is played of McSweeney following another woman, Zara Aleena’s family have their eyes fixed on the screen in front of them.Jordan McSweeney had followed a number of women on the night he attacked the law graduate.Murder-accused Jordan McSweeney failed to attend a plea hearing at the Old Bailey.The deaths of Sarah Everard, Sabina Nessa, and others have highlighted the dangers women face in Britain.A man has appeared in court charged with the murder, attempted rape and robbery of Zara Aleena.Safety tips for women continue to suggest murderers have an excuse for killing.
