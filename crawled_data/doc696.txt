Tory Lanez told Megan Thee Stallion to "dance" as he shot at her feet during an argument, a jury has been told.Prosecutors said the rappers got into a row as they drove away from a pool party at Kylie Jenner's house.Jurors in Los Angeles heard Megan, 27, insulted Mr Lanez and demanded to be let out of their luxury car before he fired five rounds at her.Lanez, 30, real name Daystar Peterson, denies multiple charges relating to a 2020 dispute with the Savage artist.Megan - real name Megan Pete - left a trail of blood at the scene, before getting back into the vehicle, which was subsequently stopped by police.A gun that was still warm to the touch was found on the floor near where Lanez had been sitting, prosecutor Alexander Bott said.Minutes after the shooting, a female friend texted Megan Thee Stallion's security detail, saying: "Help... Tory shot meg." In a later phone call, Lanez "profusely apologised for his actions" and claimed he was "just too drunk," jurors were told.Tory Lanez's lawyer George Mgdesyan said the jury needed to keep an open mind and this was a "case about jealousy".He told the court he would prove the accusations were lies.Earlier hearings have been told that Megan Thee Stallion initially told doctors her injured feet had been cut on broken glass.She initially denied Lanez had shot at her, but later said she had done so for fear he would get into trouble.Several bullet fragments were removed from her feet, but some remain and she told investigating officers that she had difficulty walking in certain shoes.Megan Thee Stallion then posted a video to Instagram Live in which she said "Tory shot me. You shot me and you got your publicist and your people... lying... Stop lying."The trial continues.Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Megan Thee Stallion living with bullet fragments in feetMegan Thee Stallion 'scared' after 2020 shootingMegan Thee Stallion 'told to dance before shooting'Megan Thee Stallion 'suffers gunshot wounds'Tory Lanez denies shooting Megan Thee Stallion'Tory Lanez shot me', Megan Thee Stallion claimsUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
