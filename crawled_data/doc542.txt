A month after the grisly murder of four Idaho students, no suspects have been identified and no arrests made in a case that has gripped the US. Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were found stabbed to death in a rental home they shared early on Sunday 13 November.This week, police said an "army of analysts" is combing through hours of video for clues amid mounting frustration over the lack  of progress. The murder weapon has yet to recovered. All four victims were students at the University of Idaho in the town of Moscow, in the northern part of Idaho. On Monday, Moscow's police chief, Rogier Lanier, said that police analysts were examining videos from all over the town that have been uploaded by residents and business owners. "As you can imagine, there's hours and hours and hours of video, so it does take a lot of time," he said.Police are still looking for a white Hyundai Elantra that was seen near the home on the day of the murders.Also on Monday, Fox News reported that police had bagged the victims' hands at the crime scene in an effort to save possible clues, including skin, hair or DNA evidence. The case has attracted the interest of thousands of amateur web detectives, and dozens of Facebook groups and Reddit threads have been dedicated to the case, but Mr Lanier warned against reporting online speculation to the official tip line. "Tracking down rumours and quelling rumours about specific individuals or specific events that may or may not have happened is a huge distraction for investigators, and oftentimes is the result of social media propagation," he said in the video statement.The slow pace of the investigation and lack of arrests or named suspects has prompted criticism from some family members of the victims. Mr Lanier said police were "still 100% committed to solving this crime".The father of Kaylee Goncalves said on Sunday that the victims had "big open gouges" that were clearly the work of a "sadistic male".Steven Goncalves said he had asked the coroner how many times the victims were stabbed. "She says, sir, I don't think stabs is the right word, it was like tears, like this was a strong weapon, not like a stab," he told Fox News. Police have not yet specified the suspect's gender, or found the fixed-blade knife they believe was used in the attack. While officials have said they don't believe there is an ongoing threat to the community, police have urged residents and students to remain vigilant and take care when in the town.
