But new rules in England, Scotland and Wales mean that anyone who has had the same sexual partner for three months or more will now be eligible to donate. All donors will also now be asked the same questions about their sexual behaviours regardless of their gender or sexuality. The changes are expected to come into effect in Northern Ireland in September.Produced by: Rob BrownFilmed by: Rob Brown and Tom BealThe gay men donating blood in the UK for the first time.
