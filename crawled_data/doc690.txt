The trial of rapper Tory Lanez over the alleged shooting of Megan Thee Stallion has started in a Los Angeles court.The accusation, and the long-awaited hearings, have sparked a war of words and divided the hip-hop world.Texas-born Megan says she was injured when Tory Lanez shot at her feet after a Hollywood party in 2020.He has denied multiple gun and assault charges, and as a jury hears both sides of the story, BBC Newsbeat looks at how we got to this point.It all begins at the party hosted by Kylie Jenner in the Hollywood Hills on 12 July 2020.Megan, real name Megan Pete, and Tory Lanez, real name Daystar Peterson, are said to have got into an argument as they drove away from the event.At a hearing last December, Los Angeles Police told a judge Megan demanded to be let out of the car and heard Tory shouting at her to dance. He then opened fire with a handgun, officers said. Megan's own account in court tells the same story - she testified that the row was triggered by her belittling Tory's musical talents. The Savage singer had initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.It was later, on Instagram, where she first said that Tory had shot her. The pair had been in a relationship but split before the accusations surfaced.He has denied charges of assault with a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle. He was also been ordered to stay at least 100 yards (91.4m) away from Megan.Megan later spoke out about her injuries - saying she needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons."I know my mama and my daddy and my granny had to be looking out for me with that one, because where the bullets hit at, they missed everything, but they were in there," she previously said.Both artists went on to reference the dispute in their work.In his song Money Over Fallout, Tory suggested the accusations against him were false, saying: "Megan people tryna frame me for a shooting."In the same track, he casts doubt on the shooting, asking: "How you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?"A few months later, Megan released her own song, Shots Fired, which accused Tory of lying "just to save face", insisting she is the one "speakin' facts".As the dispute escalated, people started taking sides, with Drake appearing to side with Tory.Megan spoke out after memes and abuse spread online, saying: "In some kind of way, I became the villain".She was accused of lying about being shot and has had to repeatedly defend herself, suggesting misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she's been targeted.Megan has received support from artists including JoJo and Kehlani. And in November, a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter supporting Megan."You don't deserve any of this, Megan. You deserve to be heard, to be believed, and most importantly, to be safe," they wrote.But Megan says she's been characterised as "aggressive" and a "snitch".About a year after the shooting, DaBaby - who collaborated with Megan on her song Cry Baby - was criticised after bringing Tory on stage after her set at Rolling Loud Festival. While Drake and Tory reportedly haven't always seen eye-to-eye the pair, who are both Canadian, are now said to be on good terms.Megan accused Drake of using her for "clout" on his track Circo Loco. The collab with 21 Savage references a woman who "lie 'bout getting shots, but she still a stallion", which many, including Megan, think is about her.He has not directly commented on the reaction to the track. When his new album Her Loss, which includes Circo Loco, dropped, Megan reacted furiously on Twitter, writing: "since when it is cool to joke about women getting shot?".She went on to say "weak... conspiracy theories" had been attached to her name and hit out at rappers who "pile on a black woman when she says one of y'all homeboys abused her".She has accused Drake of wading in for "clout".Tory remained tight-lipped when the track dropped, only tweeting a shrugging emoji on the day it was released.ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDrake has yet to respond to Newsbeat's request for comment.The trial finally started after months of delays."I can't believe I have to come here and do this," Megan said in her testimony.The jury heard how she left a trail of blood at the scene and minutes after the shooting a friend messaged her security saying "Help... Tory shot Meg".In her account, Megan told the courtroom Tory had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened.She also said he'd called her after to apologise and claimed he was "just too drunk".Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been "torture" and even disclosing suicidal thoughts.Tory's lawyer said the jury needed to keep an open mind and that it's a "case about jealousy," Outside the court, there is a divide. Supporters of Tory heckled Megan asking "why are you lying on that boy?" when she arrived.On the other side, fans carry signs saying "We stand with Megan".If found guilty, Tory could be jailed for up to 23 years.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.
