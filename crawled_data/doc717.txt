Why won't he?" the Labour leader asked.Mr Sunak insisted his government had "consistently spoken to all the unions involved in all the pay disputes", as strikes are planned in various sectors over winter.The prime minister said he wanted to "put it on record what we've done for nurses", adding that while other public-sector workers got a pay freeze last year, nurses received a 3% rise.But Sir Keir said nurses going on strike "is a badge of shame for this government"."Instead of showing leadership, he is playing games with people's health and there is a human cost," he said.While acknowledging disruption to care, the prime minister said the government was standing by the offers recommended by the independent pay review body.He claimed the strikes were "Labour's nightmare before Christmas" because of the party's links with the unions.This video can not be playedWatch: Sunak 'gone into hibernation' over NHS - StarmerIn response, Sir Keir said Mr Sunak was "pretending everything is fine"."After 12 years of Tory failure, winter has arrived for our public services, and we've got a prime minister who has curled up in a ball and gone into hibernation," he said.The SNP's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, followed the Labour leader, calling on the PM to take "the Scottish Government's lead" on dealing with public-sector strikes.On Monday, the devolved Scottish government agreed a 7.5% pay deal with two NHS unions - the Unite and Unison unions - which called off their strikes.In reply, Mr Sunak said the health secretary and other ministers had "engaged fully, not just with the unions but with an independent pay-setting process".Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey focused on the "dreadful cancer backlog" and asked the PM to guarantee it would not get worse.Sir Ed - who lost both of his parents to cancer as a child - said "40% of cancer patients now wait more than two months for treatment".Responding, Mr Sunak said "cancer treatment rates in the most recent months for which we have data are now back at pre-pandemic levels", with plans in place to fast-track testing for the disease.What will nurses' strike mean for patients?Nurses across UK back strikes in pay disputePeople are striking - here's what you need to knowUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
