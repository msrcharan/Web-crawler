lines and assess the extent of the damage, which will help us better target our
restoration strategy.“The
welfare of our customers is vitally important to us and we’re offering to
reimburse food costs for all customers currently without power and reasonable
accommodation costs for customers on our Priority Services Register who are
unable to make alternative arrangements."Anyone who has any concerns for themselves or others, particularly family members or neighbours who may need extra support, to give our teams a call on 105."Efforts to restore power to areas affected by severe
weather conditions in Shetland were boosted this morning by the arrival of a further 15 power line crews at first light.Further teams and equipment are due over the next 24 hours.Engineers
arrived on the first ferry from the mainland and Orkney to assist local teams,
with more crews leaving for Shetland throughout the course of today. In total, 125 additional engineers are supporting SSEN local Shetland teams in the
restoration effort.As

While the actual savings differ for different people, at the end of each section we explain how the savings figure was worked out.1.

Installing a water-efficient showerhead or having showers in four minutes could save you about £904. Turning down radiator valves in less-used rooms could save you about £705. Draught-proofing your doors, windows, chimneys and floors could save you up to £215Read more hereFrazer Scott, the chief executive of Energy Action Scotland tells Radio Scotland our health and wellbeing is so dependent on the warmth of the air we are breathing every day in your home.According to WHO it's between 18C degrees and 21C degrees, with 21 being the main living space Mr Scott says. He says for people who are older or who have an underlying health condition it's higher, between 20C degrees and 23 C degrees in your living space.This can be really challenging for people, particularly with the rapid increase in energy costs.Police Scotland has issued a fresh appeal for people to avoid frozen water.The force says it has recently responded to a report of children playing on a frozen pond in the Forth Valley area.The warning comes after the death of three boys who were pulled out of an icy lake near Birmingham. One of the common reasons for a boiler not working is that the condensate pipe has
frozen. The condensate pipe leads waste water away from the boiler and if fitted outside the home it can be susceptible to freezing. To thaw out the pipe, experts at the Skills
Training Group suggest these three steps:1. Locate the pipe, it should be white and protrude from the wall portion located directly behind your boiler. 2. Boil your kettle and let the water cool for
about 15 minutes before pouring it over the pipe.3. Reset your boiler and check it is working properly.The heavy snowstorms on Shetland have interrupted supplies to about 2,800 homes with many facing days without power.Laurie Goodlad, a writer and tour guide in Shetland, tells Radio Scotland's Mornings the weather has been unprecedented:"It's an island of remote communities and generally speaking we don't get weather like this."It's no usually a problem moving around, but when the roads are blocked or impassable, if you're living in the country it might be a few miles or more to find somewhere that's got the lights on."I think generally speaking as a society we're less prepared than what we would have been 20 or 30 years ago."In general we're less prepared."Giancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporter, BBC news websiteBBC news website readers have been capturing the wintry scene across the country over the past few days.Here are some of the images which have been submitted but if you want to see more, just follow this link.And if you would like to send in your own images, the email address is scotlandpictures@bbc.co.uk.The snow and ice across Scotland has been causing travel disruption this morning.The snow gates on the A939 at Cock Bridge in Aberdeenshire have been closed, while the A96 at Tyrebagger near Dyce has also been affected by wintry conditions.

snowed so much since I lost it that it's probably under about a foot of snow
wherever it is," she told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland show. The writer is offering a reward for the return of the laptop, but says she backed up a copy of her novel."People have been amazingly kind, I've been getting
responses from all over Lerwick," she said."But luckily my latest book that I've been working on,
I had sent it as an email attachment to myself just a couple of days ago so
I've not lost too much."Ken BanksBBC Scotland North East and Northern Isles reporterMatt Davenport, 41, lost power at the family home in Upper Voe, Shetland, at the start of the week.After two days, his wife and their nine nine-year-old son went to stay with her sister who does have power.

The warning covers about half of the country, including the central belt. It is in place from 06:00 to 23:59 and means outbreaks of snow and icy surfaces are likely to bring some disruption, says the Met Office. Scotland’s National Clinical Director, Jason Leitch, says the wintry weather across the country will add extra pressure on the NHS.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said more slips, trips and falls are an issue for
already overstretched emergency departments.He said: “We are not panicking in any way but we are concerned.
“Extreme temperatures of any kind are a worry for the health
and social care system.”The Met Office has extended a yellow warning for snow and ice covering northern Scotland until 23:59 on Thursday.It covers the north and north-east of Scotland, Shetland, south-west Scotland, the Lothians, Scottish Borders and Orkney.A Met Office yellow warning for strong winds is also in force between 07:00 - 14:00 in Shetland, where gusts of up to 60-65mph will accompany blustery wintery showers, especially for northern areas.CCTV images have been released showing a man who has been missing from Aviemore amid wintry conditions.

  Government Resilience Room has met to discuss the impacts of power outages in
  Shetland.Justice
  Secretary Keith Brown is the lead minister for resilience and he said:“I chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) with
  our multi-agency partners to make every effort to restore power and support
  households.“Our utmost
  priority must be to ensure that people, especially the most vulnerable, are
  safe and warm. "SSEN have contacted all priority customers and Shetland
  Islands Council has identified vulnerable people who may need extra support.
  It is also considering how buildings such as community centres could be used
  to provide respite centres if needed.“I would urge
  people to heed the Police Scotland advice to stay at home, find ways to stay
  warm, check in on neighbours, friends and family, and listen to the local
  radio or follow social media for updates.”Extra engineers have now arrived in Shetland to help local crews
repair the damage to the electricity network. A total of 15 Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks crews arrived on the freight ferry from Aberdeen, while others are
being flown in by plane and helicopter. Extra electricity poles have also been unloaded at Lerwick
Power Station to aid the repair effort. A helicopter is also being used, where the weather allows, to
