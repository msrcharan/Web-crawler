The remains of the last known Tasmanian tiger - thought lost for 85 years - have been found stashed in the cupboard of an Australian museum.The thylacine died in captivity at Hobart Zoo in 1936 and its body was given to a local museum.But what happened to its skeleton and skin afterwards had been an enduring mystery.The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery lost track of the remains, and they were believed to have been thrown out.New research has discovered they were at the museum all along - preserved but not properly catalogued."For years, many museum curators and researchers searched for its remains without success, as no thylacine material dating from 1936 had been recorded," said Robert Paddle, who published a book in 2000 on the extinction of the species."It was assumed its body had been discarded."But he and one of the museum's curators found an unpublished taxidermist's report, prompting a review of the museum's collections.They found the missing female specimen in a cupboard in the museum's education department.It had been taken around Australia as a travelling exhibit but staff were unaware it was the last thylacine, curator Kathryn Medlock told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."It was chosen because it was the best skin in the collection," she said."At that time they thought there were still animals out in the bush."The skin and skeleton are now on display at the museum in Hobart.Originally believed to have roamed across Australia, Tasmanian tiger populations declined because of impacts from humans and dingoes.Eventually the marsupial was only found on the island of Tasmania, where it was ultimately hunted to extinction.Scientists hope to revive extinct Tasmanian tigerBandicoot brought back from brink of extinctionStalking the 'elusive' Tasmanian tigerUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
