"It felt fantastic - I never thought I'd be able to wrestle again." Saraya-Jade Bevis - aka WWE's Paige - says retiring in 2018 due to a neck injury was "one of the hardest things".But then, earlier this year, she shocked the world by appearing for rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW).At first Saraya didn't appear as a competitor - but now, four and a half years later, the 30-year-old is back in the ring.Recalling the day she was medically cleared, she told the BBC: "I just burst into tears and was like this is one of the best days of my life."Her first match back was against Britt Baker - who she credits with helping her with her return - in November.Saraya, who was born in Norwich, is one of professional wrestling's best-known talents, receiving awards recognising her contribution to its women's division.With many happy to see her back, the reaction to Saraya's return was largely positive.But there was also a stream of online negativity.Compared to when male superstars Edge and Daniel Bryan returned after their career-threatening layoffs, Saraya feels there was a difference in reaction to her comeback."There was a lot more support for them than for me - whether they just didn't like me as a person or a wrestler."But she has a laid-back approach to the negative comments."If it's good, if it's bad, people are going to hate it either way, so I just have to be like: 'At least you're watching me'."A post shared by All Elite Wrestling (@aew)Saraya says her family were the first ones she contacted when she was medically cleared. But she also spoke to fellow wrestler Sasha Banks, as her neck injury happened during a match against her."I felt really awful for Sasha. Even though I was the one that got the injury, it takes its toll on somebody mentally," she said."Wrestling isn't an easy sport. And we sign up to get hurt… but it really does mess you up to end someone's career like that."She says fans of both are "very passionate" and would go "head-to-head for years" even though the pair had no issues."We were just like we don't have this rivalry behind-the-scenes," she said."Wrestling is one big family, whether you've known someone for a day or for a decade."They're all there for you and they know how important it is."Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.WWE's Paige shocks fans in debut for rival firmWhat now for British wrestling after WWE's UK show?WWE star Paige retires after neck injuryUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
