One Afghan soldier was killed.It's unclear exactly what sparked the clash at the crossing over the border, which the two sides dispute. However, it comes amid a rise in tensions between the neighbouring countries over security issues, since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan last year.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Afghanistan action "deserve[d] the strongest condemnation".The border dividing the two nations was drawn arbitrarily by the British in 1893 and is called the Durand Line.

Since 2017, Pakistan has been building a massive fence along the border - something objected to by both the Taliban, who took power last year, and the previous Afghan government.

Last month, it was closed for eight days after a gunman shot dead a Pakistan security guard.Pakistani officials say attacks launched by Pakistani militant groups from Afghan territory have become more frequent since the Taliban took power.They have also accused the new Taliban government of sheltering those groups in Afghanistan.
