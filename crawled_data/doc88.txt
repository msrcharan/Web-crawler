The US has charged five Russians and two Americans with conspiracy related to procurement and money laundering on behalf of the government in Moscow.The justice department said they were suspected of trying to obtain military-grade and dual-use technologies from US firms for Russia's defence sector.They are also believed to have conspired to smuggle sniper ammunition in violation of US sanctions.One of the Russians is thought to be a Federal Security Service (FSB) officer.The suspects and the Russian government have so far made no comment on the investigation. Three of the group are in custody; four of the Russians are still at large.In a statement, the US Department of Justice said a 16-count indictment was unsealed on Tuesday in Brooklyn Federal Court in New York City.According to the document, the defendants unlawfully purchased and exported highly sensitive and heavily regulated electronic components, some of which can be used in the development of nuclear and hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other military applications.US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that his department and America's international partners "will not tolerate criminal schemes to bolster the Russian military's war efforts". This was a reference to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. "With three of the defendants now in custody, we have disrupted the procurement network allegedly used by the defendants and Russian intelligence services to smuggle sniper rifle ammunition and sensitive electronic components into Russia," Mr Garland said.The indictment named all five defendants, including the suspected FSB officer, Vadim Konoshchenok, aged 48. He is under arrest in Estonia, facing US extradition proceedings.It alleged that Mr Konoshchenok, from St Petersburg in Russia, "would ship or physically smuggle US-origin items from Estonia to Russia, including dual-use electronics, military-grade tactical ammunition and other export-controlled items". If convicted, the defendants face up to 30 years in prison. The others were named as: Russians Yevgeniy Grinin, Aleksey Ippolitov, Boris Livshits and Svetlana Skvortsova, and two Americans - Alexey Brayman and Vadim Yermolenko.'They beat my son for refusing to fight in Ukraine'War will be 'at reduced tempo' for months, says USUkraine war: Can we expect peace talks to begin?US governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
