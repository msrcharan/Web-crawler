Young people in France will have free access to condoms from January, in a bid to minimise the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).The French president announced the new health measure on Thursday at an event for young people's health.Emmanuel Macron said young people would be able to collect them from pharmacies, and described the move as a "small revolution in prevention".In 2020 and 2021 France experienced a 30% national increase in STI rates.Mr Macron said France had educational challenges around sexual education. "We are not very good on this subject. The reality is very, very different from the theory," he said. The new measure comes alongside other health initiatives targeting the spread of STIs and improving access to contraception. In 2018 the French government started reimbursing the costs of condoms to individuals, if purchased in a pharmacy with a prescription from a doctor or midwife.Earlier this year the government made contraception free for all women up to 26 years old - a move that affected three million women. Contraception had previously been free for women and girls 18 or younger.Mr Macron added in a tweet that Thursday's announcement will exist alongside other health measures. They include free emergency contraception for all women in pharmacies, and free STI screenings without a prescription, except HIV, to those under the age of 26.Warning online STI tests aren't meeting standardsLessons in pleasure boost good safe sexUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
