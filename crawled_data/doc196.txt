Last updated on 13 December 202213 December 2022.From the section World CupFrance centre-back Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot are doubtful after both were only able to complete light training on Tuesday.Upamecano, who has been nursing a sore throat, could be replaced by Ibrahima Konate if not fully fit.Walid Cheddira is banned for Morocco after his red card against Portugal.Head coach Walid Regragui has said he will wait until the "last minute" to assess several injury doubts, refusing to rule any players out.Their key fitness concerns are Nayef Aguerd, who missed the win against the Portuguese with a thigh injury, and fellow centre-back Romain Saiss, who was forced off in that game with a similar issue. Full-back Noussair Mazraoui was unavailable for the last match, reportedly through illness and hip pain, but may come back into contention.Morocco's plan, to defend deep and spring out on the break, seems simple but it is not easy to execute it as well as they have done against some very accomplished teams.My worry is that injuries and fatigue will catch up with them here. Romain Saiss was carried off against Portugal, while there have been doubts over the fitness of fellow defender Nayef Aguerd.Morocco break with great pace and purpose when they counter-attack and I am sure they will get opportunities the same way in this game.I don't see it working to such full effect this time, though, because they might be too stretched to hold out.I would love to be wrong, just because the African side have arguably been the best story of this World Cup, but this is probably where they say goodbye.Prediction: 2-1MATCH FACTSGet the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-linkGet your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC SoundsAhead of his last chance at World Cup glory, get to know the real person behind the goalsRobin and Strike are hunting for a criminal who goes back a long way...Panorama hits the road to find out what is going on between drivers and cyclists BBC Sport charts Morocco's journey to becoming the first African nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals as they prepare to take on France in the last four.Watch all of France's goals from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as they prepare to take on Morocco in the semi-finals.Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez shine for Argentina as they beat Croatia 3-0 to reach the World Cup final.
