A female referee will officiate a men's game later in a World Cup first - and it's giving one ambitious young match official confidence in her future."It just makes the path way more clear," says Jawahir Roble, known as JJ.The 27-year-old made history herself when she became the UK's first female Muslim referee in 2020.JJ spoke to BBC Newsbeat ahead of Stephanie Frappart taking charge of Germany v Costa Rica later.She dreams of officiating a World Cup or Premiere League match herself.And, thanks to Stephanie, JJ says she can't see anything holding her back."I know if I keep working out, I will get it," JJ says. "There is no stopping now."JJ was just 10 when she moved to London as a refugee with her family after fleeing civil war in Somalia. She grew to love football after living a stone's throw from Wembley Stadium and originally held dreams of playing herself."If you're a referee, you have the best seat on the pitch," she says. "It still lets me stay involved in football."This video can not be playedIt's a good sign to see women referees at the men’s World Cup - FrappartStephanie, from France, will be joined by assistant referees - Brazilian Neuza Back and Mexican Karen Diaz Medina - at Al Bayt Stadium.Together they will form the first all-female on-field officiating team in the history of the tournament. Stephanie told the BBC it was a good development not only for referees, but for women too."Women are taking more and more responsibility in society, in the industry," she says. "It's a good sign to see women in the men's World Cup."While JJ says she's got "a long way to go" before she'll be refereeing the top league matches, "it's not a bad start" she says of her career so far."I'm on my way," she says. "It might take a bit longer but I'm not too far."JJ hopes the tournament will go some way to improving women's rights in host country Qatar.The Gulf state, which follows strict Muslim laws, has been widely criticised for its ban on same-sex relationships, women's rights and its treatment of migrant workers."It does make me feel sad," says JJ. "But we have seen a lot of female supporters in stadiums and I hope they change their mind and support women."For now, she wants to inspire more women to get involved in refereeing and sport."I want to keep inspiring girls all around the world," she says. "It's not about men or women. It's about whoever works hard and sticks to their dream and makes it happen."Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Female refs 'a positive message' for womenAll-female referee team at World Cup for first timeA quick guide to the World Cup'Players shouldn't stay silent on big issues'Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup'People will always be negative but take nothing to heart'Celebrate and support all women referees out there - RobleUS governor commutes all of state's death sentencesThe man who led Morocco to brink of World Cup historyMorocco fans' heartbreak as Doha flights cancelledHow a British special forces raid went fatally wrongCovid wave batters China's overstretched hospitalsNuclear fusion breakthrough – what is it and how does it work?Audio drama - gaming's next frontier?Using my family's dark history to teach about vaccinesTwitter Files spark debate about ‘blacklisting’The silent struggles of ADHD workersUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’ VideoUkraine’s missile graveyard 'is evidence against Russia’Ten years after Sandy Hook, school gun deaths still riseThe French breakfast you don't knowThe rise of the remote helicopter bossThe underwater sounds that can kill© 2022 BBC.
