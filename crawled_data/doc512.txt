Environmental activists were physically removed after occupying tables at an upmarket steakhouse in central London.Animal Rebellion protesters entered Nusr-Et, a restaurant which serves gold-plated steaks costing up to £1,450, at about 18:00 GMT on Saturday.The activists said they targeted the steakhouse in Knightsbridge because it was symbolic of a "broken system".It comes weeks after a similar stunt at Gordon Ramsay's three-star Michelin restaurant in Chelsea.Members of Animal Rebellion, an off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion, were carried out of the steakhouse by staff at about 19:00.One of the activists, Ben Thomas, 20, said: "We just sat there. Wait staff were quite civil but the members of the public... two of them got quite aggressive at one point." The protest group said it was calling for "a plant-based food system and mass rewilding".The steakhouse, owned by social media chef Salt Bae, has been approached for comment.The Metropolitan Police said the protest was reported to the force but the group had left before officers were sent out.Animal Rebellion said it staged a similar stunt at Manchester's Michelin-star Mana restaurant later in the evening, where it said arrests were made.Greater Manchester Police said 14 people were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and have been released on bail pending further inquiries.Mana said the protesters had "disrupted the operation of a small business that has already suffered economically from Covid and the ongoing energy crisis". Owner Simon Martin said: "We are confused as to why the protesters chose to target a restaurant that prioritises sustainability and animal welfare, instead of a corporate fast-food chain."Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
