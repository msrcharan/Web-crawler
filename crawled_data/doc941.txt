Founder Steph Taylor, 38, appealed for help finding the man."We have no idea on [his] circumstances and we would like to find out who he is to offer support with a vet check for the mum, and dog food if needed", she said.Anyone who might have already taken one of the puppies from the litter is urged to get in touch with the sanctary for help.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
