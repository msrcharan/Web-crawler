Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and James FitzGeraldAll times stated are UKRMT leader Mick Lynch says that the government needs to "compromise" and offer additional assurances on job security for his members. The current pay offer is "ridiculously low", he says.He says he has only been around the negotiating table with senior people from the railways, who are not allowed to negotiate on the government's behalf. He says the Conservatives have created a "myth" that pay rises fuel inflation, adding that inflation has risen anyway without pay rises in the past few years.The government has given a negotiating mandate to Network Rail and the train operators that says pay and conditions must be cut for rail workers, he says, adding that the government has "torpedoed" negotiations.While we've been covering action in the Commons, the RMT Union's Mick Lynch has been speaking to the BBC about rail strikes.Lynch says there has been "prevarication" from Labour leadership over this past week or so on protecting workers' rights, adding that Labour is similar to the Tories on the pay offer for train drivers.He adds that "the rich don't create wealth in this country" and says the government should be redistributing wealth from those at the top.Labour MP Liz Kendall says workers' rights "are absolutely critical". The party wants to scrap tax-free status for private schools and redistribute wealth more evenly, she says.Lynch says the public "has been largely on our side" and his union "gets an awful lot of support" from those who use trains. He adds that "everybody's at the end of their tether, GPs, community nurses... this health service is being crushed so they can get it ready for privatisation".Health minister Maria Caulfield rebuffs Lynch by saying the government is "putting record funding" into the health service.Reality CheckAt PMQs, the prime minister and the Labour leader clashed over the nurses' strike and the NHS.Labour's Keir Starmer said: "Ask anyone in the NHS, they’ll tell you they don’t have enough staff - 133,000 vacancies."According to the latest data, there were 133,446 full-time
equivalent vacancies in NHS England in September - a vacancy rate of 9.7%.Nursing vacancies accounted for 47,496 of that overall number - with a vacancy rate of 11.9% in this sector.In December 2019, before the pandemic, the total NHS vacancy rate was 8.1%.Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are set to strike tomorrow over pay.The walkout will involve Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members in more than half of hospitals and community teams.You can search here to check what NHS organisations in your area are affected.Under trade union laws, life-preserving care has to be provided - so all nursing staff would be expected to work in services such as intensive and emergency care.Read more: What is the dispute about and how will it affect patients?Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondentBeyond
the main event of the Labour leader’s questions to the prime minister, PMQs can
can sometimes seem a bit parochial. MPs
often use it as a chance to raise awareness of issues in their constituencies
and be seen to speak up for their area. Congestion
and pollution on the A3 near Guildford, gridlock in Leicestershire, problems on
the West Coast Mainline and access to high street banks might all sound a bit
mundane. But
they were all questions asked by Conservative MPs and taken together they could
add to the uncomfortable sense for the government of things not quite working
as they should, in various sectors of the economy. That
plus one Tory backbencher calling again for the UK to leave the European Court of Human Rights proved the trickiest questions for the PM sometimes come
from his own side. If you're just joining, or need a catch-up, here's what's been happening in the last 90 minutes:PMQs finished a little while ago and we've been bringing you the statement from Suella Braverman after four people died trying to cross the Channel in a small boat this morning. But here's another relevant question from the PM's grilling earlier to bring you...Towards the end of the session, Conservative MP Danny Kruger said that "in an age of mass migration" the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was "limiting our ability to control our borders".He asked whether, in light of the tragedy in the Channel this morning, the prime minister agreed that a new framework for refugees and human rights should be drafted, including legal routes. "One way or another, and if necessary alone, we must be prepared to leave the ECHR," he said.Sunak responded by stating that the government's new legislation "will deliver a system whereby a person who comes here illegally will have no right to stay, will be removed to their own country or a safe third country alternative".He said: "That is the system the British people want to see, that is the system that we will deliver, and I look forward to hearing whether the party opposite will support it."Labour's Diana Johnson, the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, asks Braverman what more the government can do to "pursue these evil individuals who facilitate and organise these trips"?Braverman says this is part of the plan announced yesterday, focusing more on establishing an "operational command" and working better with France.She says the government wants to investigate and arrest all of the people piloting the boats that they can identity.Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet - on the Kent coast - asks the home secretary how many people have been arrested and brought to trial
for human trafficking. Braverman says “there has been considerable effort and focus”
by the police as well as the National Crime Agency in tackling criminal gangs.She says this year has seen more than 500 arrests targeting 55 organised crime groups.“This work is extensive, it is coherent, and is set to increase following
the prime minister’s announcement yesterday," she says. Braverman begins her response to Cooper by saying the small boats operation command will be a "new operational command".This means setting up a new headquarters within the UK Border Force and bringing the operation under Home Office control, with support from the armed forces.Braverman says it will bring in new operational technology, such as drones and radar systems, as well as more than doubling the permanent staffing levels - with more than 100 at the new headquarters and 600 operational staff based at Dover. She says it is a sign of the government "strengthening our will" to do "whatever it takes... to stop the boats crossing the Channel".On "safe and legal routes", Braverman adds the UK has enabled more than 450,000 people to come to the UK from countries including Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan.She says "we will extend safe and legal routes once we have dealt with the appalling people-smuggling gangs".The home secretary defends the government's track record, adding that it will not stop until people recognise crossing the Channel via a small boat is not safe, lawful, or a route to a "better life in the UK".Cooper continues by saying she is pleased to hear the prime minister say
there will be more resources given to the National Crime Agency, but asks the home secretary to clarify the specifics of the migration policy announcement yesterday.“What does it mean in practice? How much additional funding will there be
in practice for the National Crime Agency - specifically for the action on
criminal gangs?"Cooper also seeks more clarity on the PM’s announcement of a new
small boat operational command, asking how different it is from what happens now. She also asks for updates on French patrol surveillance. She criticises of the lack of safe legal routes for children, and asks
when the home secretary will take action on that issue.Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper calls this morning’s tragedy “deeply
distressing news”, and gives her thanks to all of those who responded to this “awful,
awful tragedy”. She says “it was just a matter of time” before more lives were lost. Both the UK and France need to act, she says, adding that criminal gangs have made
money from those lives. “They have profited as people have drowned.” She says the other brutal truth is that criminal gangs have grown and
grown, and that authorities have failed to stop these gangs from proliferating
around the Channel.Action against these gangs has been too weak, she says.With pressure building on the Home Office to tackle the issue, Rishi Sunak has labelled the small boats crisis a priority for his premiership.Appearing in the House of Commons yesterday, he promised more staff to help clear the UK's backlog of asylum claims by the end of next year. Under the plan, a dedicated unit of 400 specialists will be set up to handle claims from Albanians, who represent 35% of the people arriving by small boats. Downing Street later said the pledge was not to abolish the total backlog - only initial claims made up to the end of June.Sunak also announced:Braverman says the government "recently agreed the largest ever small boats deal with France".She says this will mean "more boots on the ground patrolling their beaches" as well as British and French officers working together in both nations. [Read more about that deal here]"It was evident that we had to go much further," Braverman adds, arguing this was why Prime Minister Rishi Sunak outlined his plans to tackle the issue yesterday. She says this will mean if somebody comes here illegally "they can expect to be swiftly detained".Braverman says the UK "will create more safe and legal routes" and work with the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, to "identify those most in need"."It isn't true that our capacity is limitless. We are already spending millions on hotels every day. People do not need to seek asylum if they are already in a safe country," she concludes.Of this morning’s incident, Braverman says “these are the days that we dread” and that it was a “lethally dangerous
endeavour” to cross the Channel by boat.She says the government is
working hard to “tackle organised criminals”.This morning’s tragedy is the "most sobering reminder
possible of why we have to address this issue", she says. UK and French officers are
working together in both countries.Braverman says that since 2015, the UK has welcomed 450,000 people
from “safe and legal routes”, making these routes totally unnecessary. But she says we need to go much further, which is why the prime minister announced new measures yesterday.Home Secretary Suella Braverman has begun to give a statement in the Commons on the deaths of at least four people attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat.She says it would be inappropriate to go into further detail, and that there is an ongoing search and rescue operation.Braverman adds there is a multi-agency response to the incident that includes the Coast Guard, Border Force and even commercial fishing vessels.She goes on to express her profound sadness and deepest sympathies for everyone affected, as well as profound gratitude to those working on the operation. Conservative MP Saqib Bhatti says four children in his constituency struggled in an icy lake this week - three have lost their lives and the fourth, a six-year-old, is fighting for his. He pays tribute to emergency service personnel, including a police officer who broke through the ice with his bare hands to try to rescue the children."This whole event has completely shocked the local community," says Sunak, and he pays tribute to the work of the local emergency services.Labour's Feryal Clark raises the issue of no-fault evictions, pointing to the Conservative manifesto three years ago, which promised to abolish them. Will the PM now scrap them? Sunak says ministers do have plans to scrap them and will do so when there is parliamentary time. He says renters are also getting government protection in other ways. Labour's Fabian Hamilton tells Sunak about his constituent Sharon, whose 11-year-old daughter has been diagnosed with eating disorders.The daughter had to be treated for an entire year in a hospital 40 miles (64km) away in Sheffield, because there was no capacity locally in Leeds, Hamilton says.Describing the situation as "completely unacceptable", he asks Sunak to commit to improving mental health provision for young people.Sunak says he's very sorry for what Sharon's family has experienced, telling Hamilton that mental health funding is increasing to "ensure parity of service" .He adds that provision for eating disorder treatment is also expanding "because it is an issue that needs tackling".Ed Davey, Lib Dem leader, also pays tribute to the victims in the Channel. Four people are now known to have died after their boat got into difficulty.Davey says 40% of cancer patients now wait more than two months for treatment, and says he lost both parents to cancer as a child.He asks Sunak: "Can he give a cast iron guarantee that the dreadful cancer backlog won't get any worse? And when will the government meet its own cancer target?"Sunak responds by saying the pandemic had been a factor, and that cancer treatment rates are "back at pre-pandemic levels".
